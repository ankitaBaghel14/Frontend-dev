1. Difference between Frontend, Backend, and Full-Stack Development 


Frontend Development:

Focus: Everything the user sees and interacts with on a website.

Responsibilities: Designing layouts, colors, fonts, buttons, menus, forms, animations.

Technologies:

HTML: Structures the content (text, images, links).

CSS: Styles the website (colors, fonts, positioning).

JavaScript: Adds interactivity (animations, sliders, popups).

Frameworks: React, Angular, Vue.js.

Real-world Example: On Amazon, the product images, “Add to Cart” button, and search bar are all frontend elements.


Backend Development:

Focus: Server-side operations and logic that are not visible to users.

Responsibilities: Handling user requests, interacting with databases, authentication, server logic, APIs.

Technologies: Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), Java (Spring), PHP, Ruby on Rails.

Databases: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL.

Real-world Example: When a user clicks “Place Order” on Amazon, the backend handles order processing, payment verification, and storing order details in the database.


Full-Stack Development:

Focus: Combines both frontend and backend development.

Responsibilities: Can build the complete application from the UI to the server and database.

Real-world Example: A full-stack developer can create a blog website where users can view posts (frontend), create posts (backend), and store data in the database.
