        Hello, I’m Ankita Baghel, a 3rd-year B.Tech student passionate about web development and programming. I have a strong foundation in frontend development and am currently learning JavaScript, Node.js, and Express.js to become a full-stack developer. I’m also consistent in practicing Data Structures and Algorithms and aim to secure a position in a top company offering at least 15 LPA. Along with coding, I enjoy working on creative projects like building travel and portfolio websites, and I love designing and organizing things neatly.
